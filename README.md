# RPGMaker-VX-ACE-online-
Frankenstein

This is awful c++ code, but ya know what? it works. 

This is the dll component of an online mod im working on for specifically VX ACE, which could be used in making multiplayer mods of games like Lisa the painful,Jesus christ rpg trilogy (lol), others??

Ontop of this being my second c++ program, it is also way too ambitious, and thus, with my incredibly awful c++ experience, i have brought into this world the worst amalgam of c++ code i will hopefully ever write.


Im sorry.

While i do eventually want to tackle trying to do simmilar with other classic rpgmaker games, im not a very good programmer, and i only own vx ace. Rpgmaker also does a funny where the scripting language changes each time they release, so multiplayer could entirely be impossible for some versions.

WARNING: THIS DOES JACK SHIT WITHOUT THE OTHER 2 PARTS(the server, the rpgmaker ruby code) THAT I CURRENTLY HAVE NOT UPLOADED TO GIT.
