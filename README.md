# RPGMaker-VX-ACE-online-
Frankenstein
This is awful c++ code, but ya know what? it works. 

This is the dll component of an online mod im working on for specifically VX ACE, which could be used in making multiplayer mods of games like Lisa the painful.
Ontop of this being my second c++ program, it is also way too ambitious, and thus, with my incredibly awful c++ experience, i have brought into this world the worst amalgam of c++ code i will hopefully ever write.
Im sorry.
