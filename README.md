# RPGMaker-VX-ACE-online-
Frankenstein

funny little multiplayer mod idea, use my modloader (https://github.com/Anumania/RPGMaker_universal_modloader) to load this and you can play any rpgmaker vx ace game online with your friends. Currently i am hosting the server, but if you want to host your own, compile this using a different ip, weather that be a localhost, hamachi ip, whatever. 

Also im planning on making this work with every version of rpgmaker, rpgmaker vx ace as can be seen, is almost done. rpgmaker 2003 is possible and about 10% done. vx and xp are just slightly older versions of vx ace and might work without modification. mz and mv are probably doable but i havent tried.
